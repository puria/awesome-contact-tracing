# Awesome Contact Tracing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of projects inherents to contact tracing

In public health, contact tracing is the process of identification of persons who may have come into contact with an infected person ("contacts") and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts. By tracing the contacts of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, public health aims to reduce infections in the population.
